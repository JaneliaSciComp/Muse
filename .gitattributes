# Here's the deal: Life is too short to deal with git and its
# byzantine options for line endings.  So we do no translation.
# If you're on Windows, you need to use tools that can deal with Unix-style
# line endings, and you need to make sure you don't commit new files that
# have Windows-style line endings.

# Set default behaviour
# Note that this _overrides_ any user setting for core.autocrlf (I think).
#
# If you encounter problems, do:
#     git config --global core.autocrlf false
# This turns off all line ending conversions on commit AND checkout.
#
# The setting below turns off all line ending conversions for all 
# files in this project.
